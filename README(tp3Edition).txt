PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The Crucible is a 2d scroller platform game where the player will try to reach the end of each level without being killed by the various
enemies. The player can choose between 2 different game modes, standard and infinite.
The Standard mode consists of 3 levels and once the player reaches the end successfully they can now consider themselves as "good" at
the game.
The Infinite mode is never ending, and will continue generating levels as long as the player keeps reaching the end of the current level.
Please refer to the TP3 Design Docs for additional details about game features (or use the in-game tutorial).

HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT:
Ensure that the items folder and the main game file is in the same folder. Then the game should function normally when you run the main game file
in an editor. Also, it is recommended that a txt file titled exactly as follows should be in the same folder as the main game file: highscore

LIBRARIES THAT NEED TO BE SEPARATELY INSTALLED:
Pygame, as it was the only external module outside of basic Python modules (like Math, Random) that was used.

A LIST OF SHORTCUT COMMANDS:
Not really any present, but you can refer to the in-game Tutorial to see the commands a player can perform in-game. Also, 
if want to test Infinite mode or reach the end of Standard mode without playing legitimately simply set the "velX" variable under 
"#variables" to make the player travel fast and get through each level really quick (recommended value for velX is 10 if want to test progression).
